<p id="internal-source-marker_0.906602679984644" dir="ltr">On Wednesday, September 21, my wife and I made our way back to Cub Run Stream Valley Park (We originally went here for last week’s assignment).  We visited quite early in the morning, at around 9 a.m., and the weather was mostly cloudy and cool.  We chose Cub Run Park because it is basically the only place we know of that seems “untouched” and “undisturbed” in the general vicinity of Herndon.</p>
This area is a public county park and is therefore owned by Fairfax County and governed by the Fairfax County Park Authority.  Although the area that we visited isn’t noted on any map as being part of Cub Run Stream Valley Park, I came to the conclusion that it must be based on the following two reasons: first, it has the common red signage that all Fairfax County Parks seem to have (see Image 1), and second, it seems to be closer to Cub Run Stream Valley Park to the North than it does to Flat Lick Stream Valley Park to the South (see Figure 1).
This site is protected from inappropriate development just from the mere fact that it is a public county park.  I feel certain that without that, there would be a series of mansions lining the property rather than the lush green fields that we see today.  If you take a look south of the park and Braddock Road, you can see that this area is quite wealthy as there is a large subdivision of extremely large houses (see Figure 3).  Without the restrictions that we have today, it can only be expected that the subdivision would overtake the park area.
<p dir="ltr">As for inappropriate activity, the barriers lie in the community atmosphere and park signs.  Starting with the atmosphere, I feel like the vast majority of people would be deterred just from the family atmosphere with tons of children playing soccer on one end and dogs frolicking in a pen on the other end.  Such an environment really isn’t inviting for people who would do such activities, so I’m sure this keeps most people away.  Moving to the park signs, I feel that this park has quite valuable signs with a general outline for the rules of behavior.  Starting with the entrance sign seen in Image 1, it sets out the main rules governing the entire park.  Although it doesn’t provide a detailed list of things which are against the rules, I feel like it mentions those things which are most likely to take place in this area.  Moving deeper into the park the only other signs to mention are those on the outside of the off leash dog pens (see Image 2,3, and 4).  The rules seen here are extremely thorough and more direct, leading me to believe that they’ve had problems with the dogs in this area in the past.  An example rule from the signs is that “dogs must be on a leash when entering and exiting the pen,” leading me to believe that all dogs must be leashed once outside the pen.  I feel that this rule is more than required in order to keep the family atmosphere working smoothly, especially when  children are in close proximity.</p>
On the topic of sign revisions, I don’t think that I would change the current signs.  I would, however, be extremely elated if they would add signs with more rules and possibly an overview into the geology and geography of the area.  At the moment, no signs are available to let visitors know of such things as rules on picking flowers and boundaries of the actual park.  When visiting the area, we went roaming deep into the area without mention as to if we were still on county property, so I feel like that is one important addition that needs to be made.

For funding, this location works mainly off of the counties tax dollars as there is no admissions fee.  Although the nearby and connected Cub Run RECenter is admissions-based, all of the admissions fees go towards upkeep of the center, not for the attached parks (Frequently Asked Questions, Cub Run RECenter).  Notice that I noted it works “mainly” off of the counties tax dollars.  There is a local foundation called the Fairfax County Park Foundation which seems to provide some secondary funding for the parks in the area (About Fairfax County Park Foundation).  Although it does give some help, I feel like the amount would be rather small compared to some of the larger, more visited parks in the area.
