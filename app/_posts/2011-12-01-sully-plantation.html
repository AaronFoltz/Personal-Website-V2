<p id="internal-source-marker_0.9145145404618233" dir="ltr">On my daily commute between Herndon and Fairfax I often take Route 28, which means that I pass by the historic Sully Plantation more than any other historic locale (see Image 1).  Although this site makes it onto the <a class="zem_slink" title="National Register of Historic Places" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" rel="wikipedia">National Register of Historic Places</a>, this location did not make it onto that list by an expected means (Sully Plantation Historic Site in <a class="zem_slink" title="Virginia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" rel="wikipedia">Virginia</a>).  This site isn’t historic for a battle, special event, or any other bloodshed that would traditionally make a location historic, instead, it has historic value simply because it represents and showcases the history and lives of those living in <a class="zem_slink" title="Fairfax County, Virginia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_County%2C_Virginia" rel="wikipedia">Fairfax County</a>’s past (<a class="zem_slink" title="Sully Historic Site" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sully_Historic_Site" rel="wikipedia">Sully Historic Site</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The site did however start out as a semi-special place, mainly because it was owned, built, and completed by <a class="zem_slink" title="Richard Bland Lee I" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bland_Lee_I" rel="wikipedia">Richard Bland Lee</a> in 1799.  Lee didn’t only carry one of the most well-known First Families of Virginia (FFV) names, he was also <a class="zem_slink" title="Robert E. Lee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" rel="wikipedia">General Robert E. Lee</a>’s uncle as well as <a class="zem_slink" title="Northern Virginia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Virginia" rel="wikipedia">Northern Virginia</a>’s first representative to congress (Sully Historic Site).  Lee ended up with this parcel of land based on an 18th century land grant of 3,000 acres, and from there, he built up the plantation for his own use (Sully Plantation Historic Site in Virginia).  This plantation consisted of a main house, many outbuildings, a slave quarters, and several gardens (Sully Historic Site).</p>
<p dir="ltr">From this point, the Sully Plantation and surrounding lands were acquired by the government and absorbed into the 8,000 acre <a class="zem_slink" title="Washington Dulles International Airport" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Dulles_International_Airport" rel="wikipedia">Dulles Airport</a> Project, scheduling it for demolition in 1958.  Due to a massive grass-roots effort, the ownership was transferred from the government to the Fairfax County Park Authority, all but saving it from its horrible demise (Sully Plantation Historic Site in Virginia).  Since its addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, Sully Plantation has molded to showcase and present the history, lives, and architecture of  Fairfax County’s past (National Registration of Historic Places).  It is this commitment to preserving a piece of Fairfax County’s history that designates Sully Plantation as such a special place.</p>

<div>I most certainly believe that Sully Plantation is worthy of the designation and label of “historically special.”  Without such an all-encompassing historic representation of Fairfax County’s past, any notion of the way that this county used to look and feel to the people living in that time would be demolished and swept under the rug in order to further enable the high urban and suburban sprawl of the Fairfax County area.  The current population would only know the present way of life with the absence of such a historical site, so It is a hope of mine that such areas can be preserved and continually created as newer generations make their way into Northern Virginia.</div>
<p><div>
During the time of Sully Plantation’s construction in 1799, many things were happening throughout Virginia (Sully Historic Site).  First and foremost, merely 23 years before Sully Plantation’s construction, Virginia declared its independence from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Monarchy of the United Kingdom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom" rel="wikipedia">British crown</a> and adopted its first constitution (Virginia, Timeline of State History).  Following this main benchmark, Virginia moved its capital from Williamsburg to Richmond in 1780 in an effort to better protect themselves from British attack during the Revolutionary War (Capitals of Virginia).  Shortly after this in 1781, British led Col. Tarleton piloted a fast raid on Virginia’s General Assembly meeting in Charlottesville, having already fled their normal meeting location in Richmond.  Luckily, <a class="zem_slink" title="Jack Jouett" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Jouett" rel="wikipedia">Jack Jouett</a>, who caught wind of the plan, was able to make the legendary trek to beat the forces to Charlottesville and warn the assembly, giving them time to make their way across the Blue Ridge mountains to the safety of Staunton (The Chesapeake Bay: Avenue for Attack).</div></p>
<p><div>
Corresponding to these events, two other places that are associated with the time of the Sully Plantation construction are the capitol in Richmond, and Yorktown.  After moving the capital to Richmond in 1780, Virginians needed to build a state capitol in order to provide a meeting place for the General Assembly (Capitals of Virginia).  This capitol has been the primary meeting place for Virginia’s government up until the present time.  Yorktown is a prime location based solely on its history in battle.  On October 19, 1781, General Cornwallis of the British Army ended up getting bottled up in a tight situation, eventually surrendering to the American and French forces.  This surrender ended the final large-scale battle of the Revolutionary War, eventually leading to its resolution in 1783 (The Chesapeake Bay: Avenue for Attack).</div></p>
<p><div>
Based on the 1799 date of the Sully Plantation construction and my families German/Alsatian lineage, my relatives were more than likely in Pennsylvania or somewhere in the Great Valley between there and Rockingham County.  In order to find a relative that was alive at the time of the Sully Plantation construction, I would have to go back 7 complete generations at 30 years per generation.  This follows the free ancestry that I traced back online.  As far back as I can go (~1721 at 8 generations), my ancestors were born in Holstein, Germany, but died in Rockingham and Page counties.<p/>
