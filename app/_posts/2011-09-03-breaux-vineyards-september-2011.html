Today my wife and I made it to our first <a class="zem_slink" title="Vineyard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard" rel="wikipedia">vineyard</a> for a tasting.  Out of all the wonderful <a class="zem_slink" title="Virginia" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.5,-79.0&amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;q=37.5,-79.0 (Virginia)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Virginia</a> vineyards, we decided to visit the largest grape producer out of the bunch, <a class="zem_slink" title="Breaux Vineyards" href="http://www.breauxvineyards.com" rel="homepage">Breaux Vineyards</a> in <a class="zem_slink" title="Purcellville, Virginia" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=39.1344444444,-77.7111111111&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=39.1344444444,-77.7111111111 (Purcellville%2C%20Virginia)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Purcellville</a>, Va.  The wines there were wonderful!  I'm more of a red wine kinda guy, but I definitely got to see the better side of white wine today.  Almost all of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Wine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine" rel="wikipedia">white wines</a> had magnificent fruity flavors, something I just didn't get with the red wines.  At the end of the day we ended up walking out with a bottle of Chère Marie, a great white wine with hints of pineapple.

On the way back home, we ended up driving around randomly, coming upon a couple of amazing "villages" in Hillsboro and Waterford.  The best of the two, Waterford, is a quaint little village with tons of charm.  Most of the streets weren't even adequate enough for two lane driving, definitely giving us a blast from the past!
