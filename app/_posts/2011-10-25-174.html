<p id="internal-source-marker_0.5778579558245838" dir="ltr">Living in <a class="zem_slink" title="Herndon, Virginia" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.9713888889,-77.3886111111&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=38.9713888889,-77.3886111111 (Herndon%2C%20Virginia)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Herndon, Virginia</a>, there are a surprising amount of elementary level schools compared to <a class="zem_slink" title="High school" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school" rel="wikipedia">high schools</a>.  Within a three mile radius there are exactly five traditional elementary schools and a few other specialized lower level schools, with Lutie Lewis Coates <a class="zem_slink" title="Elementary school" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_school" rel="wikipedia">Elementary School</a> being the closest (see Image 2).  Comparing this to the high schools in Herndon, there is only a single school catering to the entire town of Herndon: <a class="zem_slink" title="Herndon High School" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herndon_High_School" rel="wikipedia">Herndon High School</a> (see Image 1).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further analyzing Herndon High School with Lutie Lewis Coates Elementary School, they are 4.7 miles and 1 mile away, respectively.  One could easily walk or bike to the elementary school from my apartment given the appropriate changes to the sidewalks and roads in the area.  At the moment most of the roads in the area are missing <a class="zem_slink" title="Pedestrian crossing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_crossing" rel="wikipedia">crosswalks</a>, and furthermore, crossing the roads in this neighborhood would be treacherous to say the least.  The roads happen to be extremely wide with speedy semi-blind turns which attribute to crashes occurring fairly often, so I would hate to see elementary children in this situation.  I doubt anyone would easily be able to walk or bike to the high school.  Not only is it 4.7 miles away, but there are many crosswalks along the way as well as some of the worst traffic on your way through downtown Herndon on Elden Street.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Herndon and the neighborhood in general, my housing situation is a fairly typical tightly-packed apartment complex.  Most of the houses in this area are exactly the same, so I would estimate that there are around 2000 residences within an easy one mile radius of the elementary school.  Contrasting this to Herndon High School, that area of Herndon is made up entirely of single family disconnected homes, with absolutely no apartment complexes whatsoever.  With a much less dense population, I would estimate this area to have around 500 residences within an easy one mile radius of the high school.  More realistically, I believe that just 5% of those within ¼ mile of the elementary school could safely walk or bike to and from school given the dangerous conditions and the children’s age.  Compare this to the high school, I believe at least 70% of those within ¼ mile will be able to safely bike or walk all the way to and from school.  Given that the students are much older and the neighborhood is much better suited for pedestrian transportation, this figure should be easily attained.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From these residency and percentage figures we can see the consequences on each school’s <a class="zem_slink" title="Parking lot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot" rel="wikipedia">parking lots</a>.  For Lutie Lewis Coates Elementary School, the parking lot is very minimal at most (see Image 3).  At least 20% of the parking lot is designated for <a class="zem_slink" title="School bus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_bus" rel="wikipedia">school buses</a> only, and there are really only 40 or so spots for other vehicles.  Furthermore, there are no bike racks anywhere to be seen, but there are fairly new crosswalks.  This leads me to believe that the school expects my estimated 5% to be walkers instead of bikers.  For Herndon High School, the parking lot is massive (see Image 4).  Approximately 30% of the parking lot is designated for school buses only, but that is quite a bit given its size.  The other 70% compromises around 500 to 700 vehicle parking spots.  Since no bike racks can be seen, I feel that this instead shows that the high school has to deal with a multitude of student drivers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If I were on a team with some of the school and county decision makers there are three main things that I would push to implement in order to improve the access for pedestrians and bikers: improving crosswalks, adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Traffic light" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light" rel="wikipedia">stoplights</a>, and adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Crossing guard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_guard" rel="wikipedia">crossing guards</a>.  Starting with crosswalks, I would add many more in areas where they are missing, especially near the elementary school.  Children and teenagers always love to take shortcuts, so having crosswalks in as many areas as possible will definitely reduce their risk of injury.  Moving to stoplights, I would push to install several stoplights around those intersections closest to the elementary school.  Ideally, there should be stoplights at most intersections at either school in order to force traffic to yield to pedestrians, something that is becoming a bigger problem in high-pedestrian areas.  Finally, for those crosswalks without stoplights, I would move to hire crossing guards to watch over students crossing.  This would ensure that children would use the designated crossing walks as well as forcing traffic to obey the law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taking the hypothetical situation that a tornado blasts away both of the schools next week, I would choose to relocate Herndon High School while choosing the same location for Lutie Lewis Coates Elementary School.  Herndon High School should be moved mainly to center itself in the town of Herndon.  Right now it is located on the edge of the town limits, making it an uneven trek for different areas of dense populations.  By centering it in the town limits around Elden Street, I would expect more student pedestrians as well as a more even travel times for the majority of the bus routes.  Lutie Lewis Coates Elementary School is perfectly positioned given the abundance of elementary schools in the area.  It is perfectly centered in a fairly high density area outside of Herndon allowing for the majority of the student body to come from within a mile or two of its location.</p>
