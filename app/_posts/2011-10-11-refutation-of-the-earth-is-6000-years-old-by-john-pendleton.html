<p id="internal-source-marker_0.8381824502721429" dir="ltr">After watching chemist John Pendleton’s wonderful display in the “Earth is 6,000 years old,” it’s hard not to question your own beliefs.  After all, the information seems almost too legit and convincing to not be true, so it must be the way things actually happened.  Without putting on your scientific goggles to examine this force-fed information everything seems to fit in place like a well made puzzle, but underneath, the underlying logic of his claims have detrimental flaws.  Only after you step into the scientific paradigm can you see that Pendleton greatly molded the information to his liking on two topics: the Law of Superposition and the Mississippi Delta.</p>

<div>Starting with the Law of Superposition, Pendleton first argued the age of the Earth using the Grand Canyon.  He noted that given the Geologic Time Scale view of the Earth, there should be an arrangement of complete rock layers corresponding to that view.  After some quick thought on the Grand Canyon he disregarded any validity to the Earth being older solely because half of the rock layers of that location are missing, leading me to believe that Pendleton sees the Earth as being “created” this way to begin with (Pendleton).  One geological process that Pendleton fails to realize, or just blatantly wants to keep away from us, is erosion.  There is indeed a missing gap in time found at the Grand Canyon, between 1.7 billion years ago until 500 million years ago.  This 1.2 billion year gap, called an unconformity, is due to two periods of sedimentation separated by a longer period of erosion in the area (Bentley).  Pendleton’s second argument against the Law of Superposition is found in the rocks in the Northern United States and Canada.  According to Pendleton, the rocks in this area completely overrule the Law of Superposition since the youngest layers are on top and the oldest layers are on the bottom, leading to a young Earth (Pendleton).  Again, Pendleton forgot to mention the orogenic forces of the Earth, creating the highest peaks that man has ever seen.  Given enough time and enough force, mountain-building forces have been known to completely flip layers of strata (Wiggers 149).  Not only does this refute the fact that flipped strata are contradictory to the Law of Superposition, but it also leads to the fact that the Earth must be much older than 6,000 years old.  Since the continental plates on Earth are moving between 2-10cm per year, it takes quite some time to build up enough force to completely overturn a layer of strata (Plate Tectonics).  For example, the ancient Himalayas are just over 50 million years old, so an equal or greater amount of time would be needed to overturn strata, given the right conditions (Mountain Ranges).  From both of these arguments, Pendleton tried to explain that the contradictory nature of both the Grand Canyon and the flipped rocks show that the Law of Superposition and hence the Geologic Time Scale do not exist in the natural environment, only in the made up books.  Just by merely putting on your science goggles, you can easily see that the Law of Superposition does indeed exist in a static natural environment, but that is not an environment that we can readily find on such a dynamically changing Earth.</div>
<div>
Moving to the Mississippi Delta, Pendleton tries to pull some trickery with an idea that happens to be backed up with science.  Pendleton notes that given 30,000 tons of dirt moves down the Mississippi River every hour and the delta’s current depth, it is right at 6,000 years old (Pendleton).  We know that a glacier covered the North American continent from 18,000 to 7,500 years ago.  During its gradual melting period the sea level rose, drowning out the mouth of the Mississippi River and allowing for the Mississippi Delta to begin to develop (The Natural Environment).  Since Pendleton obviously didn’t lie about its age, where did he go wrong with this one?  Well plain and simple, no one ever said that the Mississippi Delta started or was even around right when the Earth started.  Pendleton took advantage of the age of the delta and his notion of the Earth’s age being the same in order to try and prove his point.  To people that don’t catch the trickery, this nonsense might seem logical, but once you step back and see the big picture, you can uncover the deceiving stunt that Pendleton was trying to pull throughout this video.</div>
<div>
On the topic of our debate in class, I would say that the pro-6000 year old Earth group definitely won.  The group basically had to follow the seemingly logical propositions found in Pendleton’s video in order to prevail.  Although mostly everyone believes that his ideas are full of nothing other than false facts, some of his arguments are extremely hard to refute without quite a bit of research.  When following Pendleton’s arguments centered on population and genealogy, most people would be hard pressed to find a argument against his idea, and I believe we could see this shining through in the anti-6000 year old Earth group.  They really didn’t have any counter-arguments to this point, instead, they decided to go on their own path talking about the unoptimized nature of the human back, useless genes in humans, and the unmentioned dinosaur in the bible.  This should have caused trouble for the pro-6000 group, but since they went first I believe everyone saw the anti-6000 group as being weak since they didn’t really refute any of the pro-6000’s ideas.  In general, with more time, I’m almost certain that the anti-6000 group would have won.  Since I was on the pro-6000 group I can definitely tell you that we were having quite a bit of trouble coming up with refutations to the anti-6000 group’s arguments, so with more time we would have folded under the pressure
