<p id="internal-source-marker_0.00487527041696012" dir="ltr">On Wednesday, October 12th at 2pm, I visited the Interstate 66/Fairfax County Parkway corridor, much like I do every Wednesday.  The weather outside was wet and dreary, adding to the intensity of driving on such a horrendous section of road.  If I had to choose an area to convert an existing road into a toll road, this area of Fairfax County Parkway between Route 50 and Braddock Road would be at the top of my list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To start, I would charge a $1.50 toll for each use.  There would be a toll booth located at each entrance to the designated area of Fairfax County Parkway, only accepting electronic payment through the use of an electronic tag (see Figure 1).  Although the toll is for each separate use, the electronic payment process will honor each payment for exactly two hour’s time.  This means that once a person has entered Fairfax County Parkway and paid the initial toll fee, they will then be able to freely leave and re-enter the parkway free of charge for two hours.  There will be no discounts whatsoever for regular customers, High Occupancy Vehicles, motorcycles, electric cars, or local residents.  I feel that the lenient two hour time frame is more than generous to alleviate some of the burden of many motorists frequenting the parkway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the revenue from this expenditure, I would expect to receive just over $36 million dollars per year on the low end.  This figure can be calculated from VDOT’s daily use statistics, noting that each day of the year over 66,000 cars drive through the Fairfax County Parkway and Fair Lakes Parkway intersection (Thomson).  That intersection, although busy, probably isn’t the busiest section of the proposed toll area, so I would expect that estimate to be on the lower end of reality.  Based on the amount of traffic on Interstate 66, I would assume that the adjacent area of Fairfax County Parkway would have significantly more motorists per day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the revenue, there would still be significant effort to keep the up front costs of tolling this section of road down to a minimum.  Once these up front costs have been taken care of there should not be any recurring costs in the future since the operation will be completely electronic and automatic, ridding any need for paying toll taker’s salaries.  The initial installation of the complete system, however, will without a doubt cost quite a bit of money.  The entrances throughout the area will need to be completely redone, allowing for the inclusion of toll booths and gates.  That physical road work alone would probably near 50 million dollars, if not considerably more (Fairfax County Parkway/Fair Lakes Parkway).  On top of the roadwork that needs to be done, the actual toll booth systems would have to be provided.  Since the booths do not need to be manned, they can basically be an electronic receiver with gate and camera to enforce the toll requirement.  In total we would need at least 24 of these booths, 3 at each entrance, and with each of them costing around $20,000, we can expect to spend half a million dollars.  The electronic tagging that each motorist will need will be at the motorists expense, not ours, much like the E-ZPass system found at the Dulles Toll Road.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The revenue from the tolling would be used in two main ways.  Firstly, this entire portion of road badly needs to be re-paved.  Speaking from experience driving on this portion of road more than three times per week, I can tell you that it is easily the bumpiest road that I have seen in Fairfax County.  Second, I would expand the portion of road adjacent to Route 66 to three or four lanes.  During rush hour, traffic is always stopped on the ramps, and that seems to always bleed out onto the main parkway.  This causes the rightmost lane of the two lane parkway to be congested, with only one passable lane (see Figure 2).  If you’re trying to continue past 66, the journey can be dangerous as motorists jockey to get out of the congestion on the entrance and exit ramps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regardless of the need to toll, many objections will be raised against this plan.  Expect for George Mason University students and local residents to put up the biggest fight.  For the students, their argument will center around the toll price, noting that many students are already short on cash and will have to pay the toll multiple times per day given the sporadic class schedules of George Mason University.  For local residents, they will use the argument of traffic diversion.  They will argue that a toll will only cause motorists to avoid the area in search for other routes, adding to the congestion of roads that are not fit to handle such traffic (Toll Road).</p>
<p dir="ltr">To convince locally elected officials to support this proposal, I would only need to use two main arguments.  First, the money to support the maintenance of this road needs to come from somewhere.  Given the current conditions of this road, it’s obvious that there are not adequate funds to properly keep this portion of road in good condition when it most certainly needs to be.  Second, by widening the portion of the parkway adjacent to Interstate 66, we can expect to take some of the burden away from the congestion on the interstate.  Just as rush hour traffic congests the parkway side of the ramp, it also congests the interstate side.  The widening will allow traffic to easily enter and exit the interstate, ridding the area of some of the congestion on both sides of the spectrum.</p>
