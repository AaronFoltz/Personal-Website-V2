<p id="internal-source-marker_0.3212746921926737" dir="ltr">For this week’s assignment, my wife and I decided to venture deep into the heart of Loudoun County to visit the <a class="zem_slink" title="Tumulus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumulus" rel="wikipedia">Indian Mound</a> at the corner of Foxfield Lane and Route 15 (see Figure 1).  We visited the location on a cloudy Monday, September 26th at 2 p.m.  Although I am fairly certain that this Native <a class="zem_slink" title="United States" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667 (United%20States)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">American</a> site lies on privately owned lands, it seems that the owners are more than willing to share the location with visitors.  As noted on the Loudoun County <a class="zem_slink" title="Historic site" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_site" rel="wikipedia">Historical site</a>, many visitors, seemingly <a class="zem_slink" title="Native Americans in the United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" rel="wikipedia">Native Americans</a>, frequently visit the site to pay their respects (Scheel).  Even with the owners being open to visitors, the site is most certainly not fit to be completely open and advertised to the public because there are absolutely no parking spots, making visiting quite treacherous.  Furthermore, it seems as if the county is trying to hide the location as it is not highlighted by road signs or plaques noting its historical significance, clearly keeping tourists away from the location. To contrast with this Native American site, a prime location associated with European settlers of the colonial era can be found in the quaint <a class="zem_slink" title="Waterford Village, California" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.7272222222,-121.078888889&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=38.7272222222,-121.078888889 (Waterford%20Village%2C%20California)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Waterford Village</a>.  The Indian Mound and Waterford are almost exactly 10 miles apart, but they are 17 and 24 miles away from my location of residence, respectively.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the topic of advertising between these two locations, the Indian Mound is not mentioned whatsoever.  The only way to discover the location of the Indian Mound is to read the article written by Eugene Scheel titled “Indian Mounds of <a class="zem_slink" title="Loudoun County, Virginia" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=39.09,-77.64&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=39.09,-77.64 (Loudoun%20County%2C%20Virginia)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Loudoun County, Virginia</a>.” The article is currently located on only two websites, so you really need to dig deep in order to find this location. Conversely, Waterford Village is advertised all over the place since it is a <a class="zem_slink" title="National Historic Landmark" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark" rel="wikipedia">National Historic Landmark</a>.  Tons of websites mention the quaint village, and there are a plethora of road signs leading you to the historic village.  Once inside the village, there are even more historical information signs including plaques located at significant buildings and the white historical road signs commonly seen at historical landmarks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moving to the information detail for each location, I would have to say that both locations come out fairly even.  Although there is only one source for the Indian Mound information, Scheel does an extremely thorough job in explaining the historical information and significance of the location.  On the other hand, the information for Waterford seems pretty shallow and not very in-depth at most.  Although there are plenty of sources for the information online, most of them seem to reiterate or completely copy other sources’ information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to boost the advertising and make the Indian Mound a full fledged tourist site, I would first create a website specifically for the Native Americans/Indian Mound sites in Loudoun County.  I would like to see the article by Scheel placed on the website as well as a plethora of other articles explaining the history and historical significance of the Native Americans in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Piedmont region of Virginia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_region_of_Virginia" rel="wikipedia">Piedmont region of Virginia</a>.  Along with this website, I would also like to see plaques at each Indian Mound, not just the one I visited.  If possible, it would be nice to have an overview of the battle or historical event that lead to that location being a burial ground.  Finally, it would be wonderful to have road and highway signs pointing visitors towards the location of the historical sites much like <a class="zem_slink" title="Virginia" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.5,-79.0&amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;q=37.5,-79.0 (Virginia)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Virginia</a> has for any of the other important historical locations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To market this location to visitors far and near I would need a very small budget, say $50,000, and I advertise with two main things in mind.  First, I would campaign with the idea that these Native Americans were among the first Native Americans to see the “white man” after landing on the banks of Jamestown on May 14, 1607.  A fitting slogan would be “Loudoun County Native Americans, early witnesses to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Jamestown Settlement" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.2102777778,-76.7797222222&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=37.2102777778,-76.7797222222 (Jamestown%20Settlement)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Jamestown settlement</a>.”  Second, I would campaign on emotion with respect to the Indian Mounds.  As noted by Scheel, “people who appeared to be Native Americans would come to the mound in early morning or late evening and leave feathers, trinkets and arrows. Those visits continue today,” which I feel would pull at the heartstrings of the average person (Schell).  The previous quotation would do as a wonderful slogan, but another proper slogan could be “Loudoun County Indian Mounds, mourning for our Native American past.”  No matter the angle taken, I feel that either of these campaigns will suit local residents as well as out of state or international tourists.  Local residents will be brought in from the feeling of closeness to Jamestown, whereas the tourists from further away will be pulled in from the emotional feel of the locations.</p>
