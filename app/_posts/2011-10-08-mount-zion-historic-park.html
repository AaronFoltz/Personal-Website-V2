<p id="internal-source-marker_0.7540141872595996" dir="ltr">On Monday, October 6th at 9am, my wife and I visited Mount Zion Historic Park just south of Leesburg.  The weather outside was damp, cold, and gloomy, furthering the already eerie feel of the location that we were visiting.  What made this location particularly eerie was the fact that it was a church, hospital, and burial ground for a great deal of people during the time of the American Civil War.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This location found its first action at the Battle of Aldie in 1863.  At that time, the church was being used as a hospital by Union members, caring for the wounded coming back from the battlefield.  Although this battle made use of the church, it wasn’t what made it historically significant, that event wouldn’t happen for another year.  That event took place on July 6th, 1864 when Colonel John S. Mosby engaged the 150 person 2nd Massachusetts cavalry just east of the church.  On that day, the Union cavalry was looking to take advantage of an excellent opportunity to take out Mosby and his Confederate followers, but in the end, it was only the Union cavalry that got taken out (Conway).  In the end, the Union cavalry lost over two-thirds of its original 150 person backing (Prats).  During the intensity of the battle, the church was again taken over as a hospital, more than likely by the Union since they had a plethora of wounded.  After the battle subsided, the Confederates buried 12 of the Union soldiers in a mass grave in the cemetery beside the church, showing just how brutal the battle must have been (Conway).</p>

As a tourist attraction today, the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority is responsible for overseeing the preservation of this historic location.  Although the representation of the events at the site are brutal on their own, I feel that they are a bit “prettified” from what they really were.  The site has discussion on the amount of people that died, and that is extremely realistic.  What the site is missing however, is the way in which they were buried.  According to Conway, the cemetery used to hold a mass grave of 12 Union soldiers, and there is no mention of this anywhere at the location (Conway).  Furthermore, according to information from the Mount Zion Church Preservation Association, there are 63 recorded African-American slaves and freed men buried at the location, something which goes completely unnoticed on any plaques at the location (Mount Zion History).
On the topic of place names in the area that are associated with the site visited, one big example can be seen in Route 50.  Starting in Chantilly, Route 50 is properly named John Mosby Highway, running continuously for nearly 50 miles all the way to Winchester (see Image 1).  A final example can be found in Fairfax with Mosby Woods Elementary School.  It seems that this elementary school was built on a historical location linked to the Civil War and John Mosby, but no specific event can be found associated to the location (Mosby Woods Elementary School).

The following is my marker for the location:
<p dir="ltr">Mount Zion Church is located on the edge of Loudoun County, located at the highest point in over two miles at 400 ft (Mount Zion History).  Just two miles to the west of this location you can see the Bull Run Mountain Range, coming in at 800 ft, more than double the elevation of the land that this church sets on.  Being in Loudoun County, this location is part of the Potomac watershed, meaning that the water from this area will eventually flow down the Potomac River on its glorious path down the Great Falls to the Chesapeake Bay.  On a more local scale, there is a small watershed circling the church and nearby pond located on the Windy Hill Plant Farm property.  This means that all water falling in the general vicinity of the church will either end up in the nearby stream or pond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This church area is a prime area for history, and not just history from the Civil War.  Just 10 miles north on nearby Route 15 we have an area of significant Native American history.  There we can see an Indian burial mound that is still visited and mourned over today.  It is thought that this area, as well as the Route 15 corridor as a whole, was a popular Tuscarora migration route to the north from North Carolina (Sheel).</p>
