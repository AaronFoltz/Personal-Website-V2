<div>
<p id="internal-source-marker_0.28362390398979187" dir="ltr">After much running around my wife and I finally chose to visit a small stream located at <a class="zem_slink" title="Frying Pan Park" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.936421,-77.41058&amp;spn=0.001,0.001&amp;q=38.936421,-77.41058 (Frying%20Pan%20Park)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Frying Pan Park</a> in <a class="zem_slink" title="Fairfax County, Virginia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_County%2C_Virginia" rel="wikipedia">Fairfax County</a>.  We visited the location on September 14th at 9 a.m. and the weather conditions outside were superb.  Although the named stream running through the area is Frying Pan Branch, I’m almost certain that we were following a small, unnamed branch of the main branch.  For that reason, I feel like an appropriate, almost superfluous name should be Frying Pan Branch Branch (abbreviated as FPBB from now on).</p>

</div>
<div>The river flows from the Southeast to Northwest, meaning that the upstream direction of the stream is Southeast.  Although the flow is definite, the <a class="zem_slink" title="Drainage divide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_divide" rel="wikipedia">watershed divide</a> for this stream proved to be extremely tricky.  The park has a series of two water <a class="zem_slink" title="Retention basin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_basin" rel="wikipedia">retention ponds</a> located at the <a class="zem_slink" title="Source (river or stream)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_%28river_or_stream%29" rel="wikipedia">headwaters</a> of the FPBB that seem to hold water fairly well and are not dependent on one another (i.e. their water bodies are not connected).  It is my belief that the section between these two ponds is the local “divide” in this case (See Figure 1).  Since the stream headwaters across the divide is not developed whatsoever, I will call it Developing Run.  From topographic maps we can see that if “Developing Run” is to develop any further, it will have to curve around in order to go downhill (See Figure 2). For the moment, it seems to be stuck in the 370 feet elevation area, and we know that it cannot expand East much more as it will soon hit a uphill elevation gradient.</div>
<div>On a much larger scale, I would say that the subdivision seen in Figure 2 can also be considered a watershed divide.  On the other side of that watershed divide lies the headwaters of the labeled Frying Pan Branch.  Although there is no clear ridge defining this divide, I am fairly certain that the layout of the topography allows for it to work in such a manner.</div>
<div>As for the human impact on the FPBB, I would say that it is very minimal at most.  The banks of the stream seems untouched and extremely natural with lush vegetation.  The bed of the stream also seems untouched and muddy, and although there weren’t any minnows, there were a plethora of frogs.  I did notice a slight sign of human impact in the form of trail gravels crossing the stream and a small drainage connecting the stream under a gravel road.  The trail gravels seemed to be just thrown on top of the stream, and for the most part the stream has eroded most of the barricade away.  As for the cross-road drainage, I was particularly surprised by its size.  Compared to the 2-3 foot wide stream, this drainage had to be less than half a foot wide.  Although the effects of such a bottleneck cannot be currently seen, I’m certain that such a human impact will force the stream to further erode and create a more freely flowing path.</div>
<div>Environmentally, the FPBB has no human protected buffer strips of vegetation, only naturally occurring and naturally protected vegetation covers the land.  The earlier mentioned water retention ponds serve as an environmental protection against floods, acting as stormwater ponds.  The retention pond at the headwaters of the FPBB also has a very low-lying dam, further protecting the FPBB from high rising water in flash flood situations.  Although these are the main environmental protections of the area, there are a few other “engineered” controls which help to control flooding as a secondary function.  Man-made watering holes are scattered all over the property, being used by the horses on the various horse trails.  As a secondary function, these watering holes will help to gather run-off and reduce the effects of flooding in the local area.</div>
<div>Even though these controls are in place, I doubt they minimize the effects of flooding much, if at all.  The runoff from a rainstorm will more than likely be extremely destructive since the area seems to be covered with rock and clay.  Such materials will allow for rainwater to flow directly into the stream with minimal seepage, causing a flash flood scenario with quickly rising water levels.  Along with these quickly rising water levels comes a danger to anything near or around the local area.  The housing area directly North of the FPBB seems to be on a small inclined hill, but with a large amount of water, those houses would be in quite a bit of danger.  The gravel trails downstream and beside the FPBB would almost certainly be covered by a moderately strong rainstorm, all but closing the park until the water recedes.  The farmland directly South of the FPBB would also be in the floods path.  Since this open area is rather flat, a strong flood could intrude on any crops or buildings stationed in that area.</div>
<div>A potential homeowner near this area should definitely be aware of their surroundings.  In order to be fully educated in the area, I would suggest looking at the <a class="zem_slink" title="Federal Emergency Management Agency" href="http://www.fema.gov" rel="homepage">FEMA</a> Flood Plain Maps (Map Service Center).  From these maps, we can see that the majority of the FPBB is located in Zone X, a low to moderate risk area.  There is a portion of the FPBB located in Zone A, which is considered to be high risk with almost a 30% chance of flooding over the course of a 30 year mortgage (Definitions of FEMA Flood Zone Designations).  Fortunately, Zone A does not quite reach the houses in the nearby subdivision, but it is close enough that any potential homeowner should be aware of the situation.</div>
<div>Based on my knowledge of the stream and the area in general, it is my opinion that new buildings should not be permitted in the area, even if the owners are willing to buy flood insurance.  The government should clearly define a boundary where no development should occur because the signs of flooding are far too evident in this area.  From the recent flood we could see that the entire area surrounding the stream was disturbed, so any houses in that area would have been devastated.  Although the majority of the stream is considered to be a “low risk” area, I feel that this designation is rather generous given the layout of the land.  With the retention ponds at the headwaters of the FPBB, a rather small flood could easily wash over the dam, creating flooding conditions and wrecking havoc on the safe Zone X area.</div>
