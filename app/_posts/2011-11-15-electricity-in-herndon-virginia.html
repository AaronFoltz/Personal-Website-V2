<div>Growing up in rural Rockingham County where the roads are laced with telephone poles and power lines, one would think that I would have noticed the complete opposite here in Herndon, Virginia.  To be honest, I never did.  My street-view apartment on Sunrise Valley Drive is completely absent of the horrible eyesores and the problems that come along with them.  Since I’m still able to get electricity in my apartment, the power lines must be completely underground.</div>
</p>
<div>
<p>
Although Sunrise Valley Drive is absent of visible power lines, the adjacent Coppermine Road isn’t (see Image 1).  This leads me to believe that the power lines go underground at the corner of Coppermine Road and Sunrise Valley Drive before making their way into my apartment complex.  Since I have no firsthand knowledge of my apartment’s construction, I can only make an educated guess as to where the wires lead before finally making their way into my apartment.  Living with a street-view, I can confirm that the grassy buffer between my apartment and Sunrise Valley Drive is constantly being painted and worked on, so this would seem like a likely area for all types of utility lines (see Image 2).  Even more so, that grassy area is completely treeless (except for a small mulchy patch right next to the apartment with various plants and smaller trees), making it an ideal spot for placing power lines far out of the reach of tree roots.  It seems highly likely that these power lines converge at a rather large green utility box with a traditional electrical meter before weaving their way throughout the maze of apartments in my complex (seen circled in Image 2).</div>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Luckily I don’t own this property, so I do not have to worry about planting trees, power pole easements, and other headaches that apartment and home owners have to worry about.  One thing I do have to concerned about is the location of the transformer that completes the important step of converting electricity from 12,000 volts to the 120 volts that electrical items inside my apartment are able to operate on (Grymes).  Currently, the nearest transformer is located on a pole on a close stretch of Coppermine Road (see Image 3).  To get to my house, this freshly converted 120 volt power needs to travel just over the length of a football field, or well under one city block.</p>
<p>
Before my Dominion electricity makes it to this transformer, it must first be converted to 12,000 volts from an even higher voltage at a local substation.  My closest substation is located just over half a mile away all the way across Route 28 on what seems like Dulles Airport property (see Image 4).  Going even further back, my power must first be generated somewhere before making it to this substation location.  The nearest Dominion electricity generating station is located in Dumfries, Virginia (see Image 5) at Possum Point Power Station (Dominion Generation).  This facility, and my electricity provided by it, is fueled by both natural gas and oil.  According to Dominion’s website, “there are four generating units; two of which are natural gas fired, one is oil fired, and the other is a dual fired combined-cycle unit,” showing that the station is trying a vast mix of methods in order to generate the most electricity while trying to be as environmentally friendly as possible (Possum Point Power Station).  This plant seems to be in constant innovation and maintenance in order to stay as efficient and as environmentally friendly as possible, so one can only assume that this plant is operational at all hours of the day instead of merely picking up during peak hours  (Possum Point Power Station).</p>
